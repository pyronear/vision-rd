# Evaluation Pipeline

## Context

This module aims at providing an evaluation pipeline to measure and commpare the performance of pyronear algorithms.
It is split in two parts:
- Dataset management
- Metrics computation

## Installation
Make sure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) installed, then clone this repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyronear/vision-rd.git
cd wildfire-evaluation
poetry install
```

## Usage

In order to launch evaluation you need to configurate `launcher.py` and run the following command:
```bash
poetry run python evaluation/launcher.py
```
`launcher.py` configuration is detailed below.

The evaluation pipeline is composed of two steps: data preparation and metrics computation, respectively managed by the `EvaluationDataset` and `EvaluationPipeline` classes.

### EvaluationDataset

The `EvaluationDataset` class helps creating a custom dataset object suited for metric computation
The object is instanciated from an existing image folder or a hugging face repo. A dataset ID can be passed as input, by default the id will be computed from the current date and a custom hash of the dataset.
When instanciating from a local folder, the following rules must be follow to ensure a proper functioning of the class:
- Root folder must contain one subfolder named `images` and one named `labels`
- `images` folder must contain the images files, named with the following convention : `*_Y-m-dTH-M-S.jpg`, for example `seq_44_sdis-07_brison-200_2024-02-16T16-38-22.jpg``
- `labels` folder must contain a label .txt file for each image with the coordinates of the groundtruth bounding box

```text
dataset
├── images
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   └── image2.jpg
│   └── image2.jpg
├── labels
│   ├── image1.txt
│   └── image2.txt
│   └── image2.txt
```

```python
datapath = "path/to/dataset"
dataset_ID = "dataset_v0"
dataset = EvaluationDataset(datapath, dataset_ID=dataset_ID)
```

### EvaluationPipeline

The EvaluationPipeline class helps launching the evaluation on a given dataset. The evaluation is launched as follows:

```python
evaluation = EvaluationPipeline(dataset=dataset)
evaluation.run()
evaluation.save_metrics()
```

The complete evaluation is composed of two part : `ModelEvaluator`, which provides metrics on the model performance alone, and `EngineEvaluator` which provides metrics on the whole detection pipeline in the PyroEngine. 

The object can be instanciated with the following parameters as input:
- `self.dataset` : `EvaluationDataset` object
- `self.config` : config dictionary as described below
- `self.run_id` : ID of the run, will be generated if not specified
- `self.resume` : if True, we check for existing results in the result folder associated to this run_id 

`config` is a dictionnary that describes the run configuration, if not in the dictionnary, the parameters will take the default values shown below.
```json
{
    "nb_consecutive_frames" : 4,  # Number of consecutive frames taken into accoun in the Engine
    "conf_thresh" : 0.15,         # Confidence threshold, below which detections are filtered out
    "max_bbox_size" : 0.4,        # Bbox size above which detections are filtered out
    "iou" : 0.1,                  # IoU threshold to compute matches between detected bboxes
    "eval" : ["model", "engine"]  # Parts of the evaluation pipeline
}
```

### Launcher configuration

The evaluation can be launched on several configuration at once. `launcher.py` is used to configure the runs:

```python
configs = [
        {
            "model_path" : "path/to/model_1.pt",
            "conf_thresh" : 0.1,
        },
        {
            "model_path" : "path/to/model_2.onnx",
            "max_bbox_size" : 0.12,
            "eval" : ["engine"]
        },
        {
            "model_path" : "path/to/model_3.pt",
            "eval" : ["engine"]
        },
    ]

    for config in configs:
        evaluation = EvaluationPipeline(dataset=dataset, config=config, device="mps")
        evaluation.run()
        evaluation.save_metrics()
```

### Results

Metrics are saved in the `results` folder, in a subdirectory named as the run_ID.
The data is stored in a json file with the following content.
The file contains:
- model_metrics : result of ModelEvaluator
- engine_metrics : result of EngineEvaluator
- config : run configuration
- dataset : dataset information

## Useful definitions

### EvaluationDataset()
`dataset = EvaluationDataset(datapath)`: 
- `dataset.sequences`: list of image Sequence within the dataset. 
- `dataset.hash`: hash of the dataset
- `dataset.dataframe`: pandas DataFrame describing the dataset

### Sequence()
`Sequence` : object that represents a sequence of images.
- `sequence.images`: list of CustomImage objects, corresponding to image belonging to a single sequence
- `sequence.sequence_id`: name of the sequence (name of the first image without extension)
- `sequence.sequence_start`: timestamp of the first image of the sequence

### CustomImage()
`CustomImage`: object describing an image
- `image.path`: file path
- `image.sequence_id`: name of the sequence the image belongs to
- `image.timedelta`: time elapsed between the start of the sequence and this image
- `image.boxes`: ground truth coordinates
- `image.prediction` : placeholder to store a prediction
- `image.timestamp`: capture date of the image
- `image.hash`: image hash
- `image.label`: boolean label, True if wildfire present False otherwise
- `image.name`: image name
